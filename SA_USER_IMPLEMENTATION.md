# System Admin User ('sa') Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a permanent system admin user with username 'sa' to the document management system backend. This user is automatically created and protected from deletion or modification.

## Credentials
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: `SR2025$!`
- **Role**: `admin`

## Implementation Details

### 1. UserDb.cs Changes
- Added system admin constants for username, password, and role
- Added `EnsureSystemAdminUserExists()` method that runs during database initialization
- Added `IsSystemAdminUser()` helper methods (by username and by ID)
- Added `GetUserById()` method for user lookup
- Modified `DeleteUser()` to prevent deletion of 'sa' user (throws `InvalidOperationException`)

### 2. UsersController.cs Changes
- Updated `Delete()` endpoint to handle system admin protection
- Returns HTTP 400 (Bad Request) when attempting to delete 'sa' user
- Provides clear error message: "Cannot delete the permanent system admin user 'sa'."

### 3. AuthController.cs Changes
- Fixed JWT role claims to use `ClaimTypes.Role` for proper authorization
- This ensures the 'sa' user has correct admin privileges

### 4. Configuration Changes
- Added JWT configuration to `appsettings.json` for testing
- Changed target framework from .NET 9.0 to .NET 8.0 for compatibility
- Downgraded package versions to be compatible with .NET 8.0

## Security Features

### Automatic Creation
- The 'sa' user is created automatically when the database is initialized
- If the database is reset/deleted, the 'sa' user will be recreated on next startup
- Uses BCrypt hashing for password security

### Deletion Protection
- API calls to delete the 'sa' user will fail with HTTP 400 error
- Business logic prevents accidental or intentional removal
- Clear error messages inform users why deletion is not allowed

### No Password Change Protection
- Currently, there are no password change endpoints in the system
- If password change functionality is added later, similar protection should be implemented

## Testing Results
All tests passed successfully:

✅ **User Creation**: 'sa' user is automatically created on database initialization  
✅ **Authentication**: 'sa' user can log in with the specified password  
✅ **Authorization**: 'sa' user has admin privileges and can access protected endpoints  
✅ **Deletion Protection**: API returns 400 error when attempting to delete 'sa' user  
✅ **Persistence**: 'sa' user is recreated if database is reset  
✅ **Normal Operations**: Regular user create/delete operations work unchanged  

## Files Modified
- `server/Services/UserDb.cs` - Core user database operations
- `server/Controllers/UsersController.cs` - User management API endpoints  
- `server/Controllers/AuthController.cs` - JWT role claim fix
- `server/appsettings.json` - JWT configuration for testing
- `server/server.csproj` - .NET version and package compatibility

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Existing users and operations continue to work normally  
- No breaking changes to API endpoints or authentication flow
